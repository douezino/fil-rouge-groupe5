Projet Groupe 5 - webApp
We are deploying the app to Openshift
We use command line OP CLI for that:

The setting.py has a psotgresql database set up for openshift or for normal django+postgresql project:
To run migrations:
python3 ./manage.py migrate --database=default

OR either of the commands for one migration.

We use gunicorn to serve the app in the pod and have a script in app/py that will migrate the database and runserver



Deployment:
- Your postgresql database:
oc new-app postgresql POSTGRESQL_USER=<your_user_name> POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=<your_database_name> POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=<your_password>

- Your github repo app (Openshift will recogniwe and read from app.py):
oc get pods -o wide # to get the ip address of your Openshift deployed postgresql IP address
oc new-app --strategy=source <openshift_compatible_os_image>~<your_github_repo_url>.git#<your_branch> DJANGO_SECRET_KEY="<set_a_long_secret_key_string>" DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME=<openshift_postgresql_service_name(like DNS)> DATABSE_NAME=<database_user> DATABASE_USER=<user> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password>

- Create a route when your application is deployed. Deploy Postgresql before your application.

We successfully used: centos/python-38-centos7

For a minimal CI/CD: 
Create more tests (that works)
Sonarqube and django test will run in Github Actions.
You need to go settings (of your repository) to create a Webhook:
From the Openshift console, after running your deployment commands, you need to get the "Developer" Console,
click on the left side "Builds" tab, Then, Select your application and scroll down, your will see the Webhook part:
- Get the Github one "With Secret", paste that URL in your Gihub Repository Settings > Webhooks > Add Webhook (Select option for push trigger, select Application/Json), then, save leaving rest to default settings.

From now whenever your push to your upstream branch, you will get the app deployed on Openshift automatically and test running on Github Actions.
You will be notified by email, if you have set your Github account properly, telling you about the status of the tests.

Enjoy!
